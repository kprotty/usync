//! #![feature(strict_provenance)] is currently a nightly api at the time of writing.
//!
//! It's a way to maintain pointer meta-data useful to both the compiler and required
//! for soundless by certain platforms like CHERI or other segmented memory systems.
//!
//! This API for interacting with pointers was designed in this issue:
//! https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228
//! and extention methods required for AtomicPtr usage were added manually as well.
